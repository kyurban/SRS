# SRS Document for Cafeteria Ordering System

In collaboration with my peers, we prepared a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for my graduate course <strong>Software Systems, Standards, and Requirements</strong>. This document provides an in-depth analysis of the requirements for the “Cafeteria Ordering System."

Document Purpose:

The purpose of this SRS document was to detail the system's objectives, constraints, and interactions with external systems. Additionally, it aims to provide a clear understanding of the system requirements for stakeholders and to obtain their approval.

System Overview:

The Cafeteria Ordering System is designed to facilitate online meal orders for a virtual restaurant. The system will enable users to place orders for delivery to various locations, including home, office, or any custom address. It is intended to enhance the ordering experience and streamline the delivery process.
